## Instructions:

Create an app that accomplishes the following:


    1. Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of your choice and display them for the user. Each scraped article should be saved to your application database. At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article:

    2. Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.

## Installation of the app:

    1. Fork this repo and clone the forked repo to your computer. You will need node.js installed on your system.
    2. At the command line navigate to the apps folder and run npm install, this will install the npm dependencies from the package.json file.
    3. Install mongodb on your machine then run an instance of the db, if necessary -> https://www.mongodb.com/
    4. Then run node server.js the console should log the port number the app will be on (currently 8080).
    5. Go to your browser and type http://localhost:8080 into the address bar to bring up the app.
